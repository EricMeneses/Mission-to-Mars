# Mission-to-Mars
For this challenge, we were asked to create an app that would scrape data from NASA so that the most up to date information could be compiled in one click. We were successful in creating a "scrape button" that would filter through the NASA website to locate specific information we were looking for (i.e. Mars specific data). We also created 4 Mars hemisphere thumbnails as part of the challenge. We made sure that the code we created could be modified for mobile devices as well (seen below).

## Challenge Summary
This challenge was a great way to learn how to create a program that would fetch data from other sources and have the most up to date resources. I think the only issue that may arise is that if the website we are scraping data from changes its url, is reformated or no longer available, the data we are looking for will not exist.
