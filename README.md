# Mission-to-Mars
For this challenge, we were asked to create an app that would scrape data from NASA so that the most up to date information could be compiled in one click. We were successful in creating a "scrape button" that would filter through the NASA website to locate specific information we were looking for (i.e. Mars specific data). We also created 4 Mars hemisphere thumbnails as part of the challenge. We made sure that the code we created could be modified for mobile devices as well.
